If you haven't seen it yet, check it out here: <https://github.com/Sitecore/ASP.NET-Core-SDK>\n\nW﻿ith the release (or the planning of) this open-source SDK, the old Headless Rendering SDKs have not been updated past version 21.x while JSS has received recent updates specifically for Sitecore 10.4.\\\nT﻿his will most likely mean that at some point everyone will have to switch to the new SDKs when breaking changes occur in future Sitecore releases.\n\nT﻿he open-source version of this SDK does come with some improvements compared to the old version, which I will highlight in the rest of this article.\n\n## M﻿ultisite support"
